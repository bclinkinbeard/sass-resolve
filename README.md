# sass-resolve [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/sass-resolve.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thlorenz/sass-resolve)

Resolves all sass files in current project and all dependencies to create one sass file which includes them all.

```js
// TODO
```

## Status

Nix, Nada, Nichevo, Nothing --> go away!
## Installation

    npm install sass-resolve

## API

## Note

Sourcemaps compatible with Chrome and Firefox only get generated properly with `sass v3.3+` and not at all with
`libsass` at this point -- the latter is very sad :(.

Therefore please do: `[sudo] gem install sass -v '>=3.3.0alpha' --pre` if you want them (and you should).
